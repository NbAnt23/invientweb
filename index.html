                Invient Data Monitoring, an outsourced service, frees up in-house LP staff from the recurring burden of

                Invient Funds, a software package, allows LPs to track investments, study trends, perform what-ifs, and
                create in-depth reports with ease.
                <br>
                Invient also builds custom software applications for LPs and others who serve LPs, such as custodians,
                trustees, and advisors.
                <br>
                Headquartered in the Silicon Valley as a division of Global Automation, Inc., Invient has about 50

        <p>Invient Data Monitoring is an outsourced service that frees up private equity LPs from the recurring burden
            of
            collecting and recording details about the funds they invest in.</p>

        <p>When you outsource to us, we extract details from GP quarterly reports, daily transactions, and our own
            research
            channels. We then record them in the database system of your choice*.</p>

        <p>Our analysts work from our office and remotely enter data into computers located in your office, allowing you
            to
            have total control of the database.</p>

        <p>We are accurate, responsive, and cost-effective. Our clients typically experience a 75% drop in their
            data-monitoring costs by outsourcing to us. They also eliminate the staffing issues created by fluctuating
            workloads.</p>
